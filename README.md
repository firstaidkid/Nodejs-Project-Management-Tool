Nodejs-Project-Management-Tool
==============================

A project management tool using nodejs and mysql.

NOTE:
This project is very much WORK IN PROGRESS.


It is a side project for my current internship and is scheduled to have a presentable state at the end of september.

The github repository is more for synchronising my files on different machines then to "show the project".
This is my first open source project, so feel free to correct me if anything goes wrong - but dont be mean! :)
