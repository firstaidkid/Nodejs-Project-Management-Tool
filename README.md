Nodejs-Project-Management-Tool
==============================

A project management tool using nodejs and mysql.

NOTE:
This project is very much WORK IN PROGRESS.


It is a side project for my current internship and is scheduled
to have a presentable state at the end of september.

The github repository is more for synchronising my files on different machines then to "show the project".
But if anyone finds something interesting in the files or has improvements I would be very happy to know.
